The most common calling convention for the Motorola 68000 series is:
  - d0, d1, a0 and a1 are scratch registers
  - All other registers are callee-saved
  - a6 is the frame pointer, which can be disabled by a compiler option
  - Parameters are pushed onto the stack, from right to left
  - Return value is stored in d0

a7 is stack pointer


move.b = byte = char
move.w = word = short
move.l = long = int
